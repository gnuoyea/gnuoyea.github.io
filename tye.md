_“…And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, in the light of His glory and grace.”_

One of my favorite hymns, “Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus”, was inspired by a woman who laid down her life to focus on serving the Lord. In 1888, Lilias Trotter chose to reject an opportunity to pursue an all-consuming career as an artist in London—in order to follow a deep calling to seek out the lost as a missionary in North Africa.

Trotter’s decision didn’t make much sense to those around her. Why would such a talented young artist give up such potential glory to go and live alone in the desert, far from everything she once knew? The answer lies in the inevitability of focused interests. In Trotter’s own words, we must aim to make our lives “narrow as regards to self-seeking” as Christ’s life was, and yet “broad as the love of God to all around”. When we are faced with the decision of where to place the true focus of our souls, Jesus is the only one who is worthy—because He paid the price.

Even in the midst of darkness, Jesus the ultimate Healer meets us, inviting us into fellowship with him. When we long for the fleeting lights of this world, He shows us the light of unfailing love and all else dims in comparison. For we serve a God who, because of His goodness, engages in a faithful pursuit of distracted and scattered hearts.

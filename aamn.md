## At a moment's notice

It’s 1am, but here we are…

_When I was in third grade (circa 2012), my best friend’s mom carried her flip phone in her back pocket wherever she went. I remember my mom often commenting on how strange this behavior was—why did she feel the need to be able to be reached at a moment's notice? How could one possibly go through life as a functioning human being whilst being so easily distracted?_

Looking back, the irony is striking. In my own struggles in resisting over-engagement with my own devices, I am often reminded of these simpler times. If a communication device as simple as a flip phone has the potential to cause everyday interruptions, maybe the problem we face does not entirely originate from the slew of advances that have ultimately created the modern smartphone…

A few years ago, before moving across the country for college, I got my first phone. I didn’t realize it at the time, but as the months went by, my life became increasingly dependent on this handheld device that boasted a mere 41 cubic inches. Haphazardly scribbled post-it notes slowly became neatly color-coded blocks on a glowing screen, and pushing the little button on my quietly beeping alarm clock every morning turned into twenty blaring renditions of the second movement of Mozart's _Piano Sonata No. 12_—each forcefully interrupted in seconds by my abuse of the swipe-to-snooze feature. (To anyone who’s had to endure the auditory trauma that came along with being my roommate at any point during the past few years, I am so sorry…) Grasping at these small changes that cut through all aspects of daily life, I think that what I miss most are the quiet, peaceful moments, uninterrupted by the possibility of a buzzing notification. It seems that the consequence of engagement with devices is disengagement with the present.

Waves of recognition of all these somewhat disturbing dependencies can quickly lead to compulsive thoughts of _running away from it all_—attributing these problems to my surrounding culture, and swearing to build a teepee in the forest with a bundle of sticks and never come back. Yet the reality is that I frequently rely on the convenience of high-speed Zoom calls across continents, and that the sometimes burdensome expectation of digital attentiveness enables the privilege of connection with others through instantaneous communication. At the same time, quicker is not always better—the level of authenticity among forms of communication is undoubtedly correlated with the amount of effort required—from double-taps on social media to phone calls, and from text messages to handwritten letters. But as in all things, there is certainly a time and a place for each of these forms.

When does a feature become a necessity for the function of a society? The need for technological advances can be a self-fulfilling prophecy—solving an inessential problem, becoming dependent on the solution, and abandoning simpler methods even when they might in fact have been more efficient. If I did not have the ability to set multiple alarms every morning, maybe I’d have retained the ability to wake up with just one faithful _beep-beep-beep_.

My frustration does not lie in the existence of advanced methods of digital communication, but rather in their invasiveness. Our devices demand our attention, and our culture necessitates oneness with our devices to fulfill expectations of availability. I won’t deny that losing control of the ability to be contacted on one’s own terms is primarily a matter of self-control. However, for means of perspective, I’m thankful to remember the blissful ignorance of not knowing whether the landline was ringing unless it happened to be within earshot—and not being expected to know either.

I don’t have a good conclusion. I am, like everyone else on the planet, perpetually attempting to reduce the unrelenting grasp that my devices have on all aspects of my existence—in this succeeding from time to time, yet largely failing miserably.

# Orion's Belt

The music library at Wellesley is a good place to go for balance. The quiet basement provides a focused study environment, but stay too late and you’ll be quickly ushered out by student workers so that it can close for the night. 

After studying for a couple hours with a good friend who shares my passion for finding ideal study spots, we left the library a few minutes before midnight. While walking back, we often talk about how much longer we’ll be up, and she always reminds me that I could just sleep and finish my work tomorrow morning. For me, this requires a large quantity of self-control. My mom says that the best song to describe me is “Till I Collapse” by Eminem. Yeah, you can probably guess what she means based on the title.

Tonight, the sky was clear, and the air was crisp. Looking up at the stars, we paused to take it in. We both noticed a small line of three faint stars. “If I take my glasses off they almost disappear…” It might sound silly, but usually when I look up at the sky, I try to find the big and little dipper and call it a day. “Oh, I think it’s part of the little dipper!” But the more we looked, the less it looked like the little dipper. An internet search revealed that these stars were Orion’s belt! We tilted the image and held it up to the sky, and suddenly the rest of the pattern came into view. Here’s the best out of about a dozen photo attempts between the two of us:


(You’ll just have to trust me that it was pretty awesome in real life. Orion near the bottom right.)

“It’s been a while since I looked up,” she said. “Yeah, if I were alone, I’d just be walking back quickly with my head down, probably with earbuds in…” My music taste lately reflects my tendency to immerse myself into chaos in order to disengage. Official genre names aside, an internet search labels my music as alternative rock, maybe sometimes merging into nu metal. I’ve been loving Green Day, Linkin Park, Nickelback, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. For some reason, their more lighthearted songs seem to change the feeling in the air, reminding me of a bigger perspective beyond my own little life.

Constellations are one thing, but if you look at each of the stars individually, they seem to be blinking on and off. “Probably something to do with light refraction.” Indeed, as the beam of light travels from its faraway source to our eyes, small atmospheric disturbances bend its path. To me, with my lack of knowledge of the actual physics behind this, it’s a wonder that the light can even reach my eyes at all. 

To me, witnessing the glory of nature moves me to praise its Creator. “And God made the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars” (Genesis 1:16). But he didn’t stop there. “He [the Lord] determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names” (Psalm 147:4).

The same God who set the stars in place, numbered them, and even named them—also created you and me. One thing you can’t deny about His creation is that it is detailed beyond our comprehension.

But if I didn’t know better, the twinklings of each of the stars, while magical, would cause a sneaking sense of suspicion. It might seem silly, but… “It reminds me of The Truman Show… have you ever watched that movie?” It’s the one where all the people in this guy’s life are basically just actors, and he ends up deciding to plan an escape route out of it. “If that were you, would life still be worth it?”

My sense is that the writers of this movie would answer with a resounding no. Truman had a sense that the world he was in was not it, and made the logical conclusion that there must be something more, and decided to take the leap of faith to go out and find it. The terrifying reality was that he didn’t really know what was out there, but what he did know was that it was worth sacrificing the life he currently had in order to find out. While this may not have been the main message of the movie, we’ve all probably had a similar feeling at some point in life—that there must be something out there, beyond the world that we’re in.

Putting existential questions on pause, for me, looking up at the stars can also evoke a vivid sense of nostalgia. I remember late nights in the warm Southern California air as a kid, dragging lawn chairs out to the asphalt behind our condo with my dad, on the lookout for a rumored meteor shower. I don’t remember what assignments I turned in that day, but I do remember the surge of wonder as I looked up at a sky that was more vast, beautiful, and animated than I had remembered.

There’s no real reason to look up at the night sky. It won’t check another item off the to-do list, but alas… we’re all always busy, all the time. I don’t know about you, but I think I ought to be looking up more often. You never know what you might find.
